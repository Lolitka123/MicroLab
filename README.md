## Features

- **Artificial Life Simulation**: Experience the dynamics of life-like structures.
- **Emergent Behavior**: Watch how simple rules lead to complex interactions.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Engage with stunning generative art.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and educators in biology and computer science.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Observe how particles interact in a shared environment.
- **Cellular Automata**: Understand the principles behind cellular automata through hands-on experimentation.

## Installation

To get started with MicroLab, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit our [Releases](https://github.com/Lolitka123/MicroLab/releases) section to download the latest version of the software. You will find the necessary files there.

2. **Install Processing**: MicroLab is built using Processing. Make sure you have the latest version of Processing installed. You can download it from the [Processing website](https://processing.org/download/).

3. **Open the Sketch**: After downloading, extract the files and open the `.pde` file in Processing.

4. **Run the Simulation**: Click on the run button in Processing to start the simulation.

## Usage

Once you have the software running, you can interact with the simulation in various ways:

- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify parameters to see how they affect the behavior of particles.
- **Observe Interactions**: Watch how particles form patterns and structures over time.
- **Experiment with Rules**: Change the rules of interaction to create different emergent behaviors.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different settings. Each adjustment can lead to unexpected and interesting results.

## How It Works

MicroLab utilizes principles from biology and computer science to simulate particle interactions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the system operates:

1. **Particle System**: Each particle behaves according to a set of rules. These rules dictate how particles move, interact, and change states.

2. **Emergent Behavior**: By starting with simple rules, complex behaviors emerge. This phenomenon is known as emergent behavior, where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

3. **Cellular Automata**: The simulation incorporates concepts from cellular automata, where each particle can be thought of as a cell that interacts with its neighbors.

4. **PDE (Partial Differential Equations)**: The software also uses PDEs to model the diffusion and interaction of particles over time.

This combination of techniques allows for rich, dynamic simulations that mimic biological systems.
